### Background:
Global Happiness is a data visualization that uses the results of the World Happiness Report 2021. Specifically, it looks at the Ladder Score, which is a numerical value between 1 and 10 representing the level to which people report to feeling happy with their lives.

Global Happiness uses a color scale to represent the varying degrees of happiness across the world, with darker colors indicating lower levels of happiness and lighter colors indicating higher levels of happiness.

### Functionality & MVPs:
In Global Happiness, users will be able to:
- Hover over a country to reveal the specific Ladder Score pertaining to the country as well as other factors that contribute to its score.
- Zoom in an out to view the map more clearly.
- Use the color legend to understand what the color of a country signifies.
- Click on the link to the World Happiness Report to learn more about the study.

In addition, Global Happiness will include:
- A description about what the data signifies and how to interact with the visualization.
- A footer at the bottom of the page with the year and my name.
- A favicon.
- A README file that explains the functionality and purpose of the project, including a Table of Contents, screenshots, and code snippets.

### Technologies, Libraries, & APIs:
- npm to manage packages in the JavaScript environment.
- Webpack to bundle JavaScript modules.
- D3 library to represent the data using a world map.
- Kaggle to source data from the World Happiness Report 2021.

### Implementation Timeline:
- FRIDAY AFTERNOON & WEEKEND: Create the project skeleton and basic HTML and CSS to render in the browser. Read about and experiment with the D3 interface. Create a map using TopoJSON, and load the dataset into the project. Connect the dataset with the map, so that each HTML element representing a country is somehow linked to the respective row in the CSV file.
- MONDAY: Create a color legend that changed the map representation when hovered over. Also create an element that appears with specific information about the Ladder Score when individual countries are hovered over.
- TUESDAY: Use HTML and CSS to create a simple navbar and instruction modal for the page.
- WEDNESDAY: Work on the CSS styling to create a clean, user-friendly design. Troubleshoot any last minute issues.
- THURSDAY MORNING: Deploy World Happiness to GitHub Pages and prepare for presentation in the afternoon.
